# Other significant projects of LRQ3000

Here is a list of other projects I am particularly proud to have contributed to, whether or not they are popular:

* [videogestalt](https://github.com/eobrain/videogestalt), an innovative way to visualize a complete overview of any video of any duration with a single glance.
* [oacs](https://github.com/lrq3000/oacs), a 2013 experimental bayesian generative AI model of players behaviors to then function as an unbreakable anti-cheat system.
* [authordetector](https://github.com/lrq3000/author-detector), a multi-algorithms machine learning prototyping framework. This was made before scikit-learn existed, and it was made to implement a similar idea with a similar API (learn vs predict). This is a generalization of the OACS framework. It implemented a proto-colored Petri networks system to ensure consistency (ie, the freeform combination of machine learning steps should not lead to modules being fed inadequate inputs).
