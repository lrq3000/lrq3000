### Welcome to LRQ3000 GitHub softwares repository ðŸ‘‹

I am an artificial intelligence researcher and clinical neuroscientist, with a specialty in magnetic resonance imagery. Open-source softwares developer & maintainer, especially in Python and MATLAB. I am particularly interested in researching biological consciousness, artificial consciousness, and circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders. Founder of the [Circadiaware Collective](https://github.com/circadiaware).

A few of the most popular of my works:
* [reedsolo](https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/reedsolomon): co-author and current maintainer since 2015. The only universal Reed-Solomon codec implementation publicly available. Used by key industrial actors, such as Matter, the 2022 communication standard for connected appliances, and Espressif, a world leading producer of reprogrammable electronic boards and the chosen solution for most scientific prototyping devices to large scale industrial applications.
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm): core co-developer between 2015 and 2017, still 2nd largest contributor as of 2023. An easy to use yet surprisingly extensible and infinitely fast progress bar: when you can't make an app fast enough to be invisible, you can show how much time it will take. I made significant contributions to redesign the core routines to make it much more extensible and responsible and formally guarantee its speed, which led to its wide adoption not only in the Python ecosystem but also beyond in most data science and especially artificial intelligence software, including from big industrial actors such as Google, Meta, etc.
* [Coma Science Group MRI Protocol](https://github.com/lrq3000/mri_protocol): A clinical and research 3T magnetic resonance imagery protocol running under 30 minutes, presented at CME2019, and which can be analyzed with a companion set of tools [csg_mri_pipelines](https://github.com/lrq3000/csg_mri_pipelines). Most research protocols last at least 1h, some even up to 2h, but this protocol is optimized not only for speed but also accuracy and to produce a wide array of modalities (sub-second fmri, multi-shells dwi, flaws = structural T1 with physiological segmentation), all under the time constraint of clinical settings (ie, in hospitals, where we are often limited to 30 minutes).
* [VLiDACMel](https://circadiaware.github.io/VLiDACMel-entrainment-therapy-non24/SleepNon24VLiDACMel.html): A management therapy for the sighted Non 24 circadian rhythm disorder, along with a workbook on current circadian sleep-wake rhythm science, all published under Creative Commons. This management (not curative) protocol is not (yet) peer-reviewed, but is already showing excellent results in 1-of-N experiments. Companion projects include [Wearadian](https://github.com/Circadiaware/wearadian), a protocol and material design specifications using cutting-edge technologies for the long-term, continuous and accurate acquisition of circadian sleep-wake parameters in out-of-the-lab settings, and [MyNon24Sleep](https://figshare.com/projects/MyNon24_-_A_self-study_of_the_circadian_rhythm_and_its_altering_factors/101804), a self-study of the circadian rhythm and its altering factors, with a longitudinal 24/7 year-long dataset of circadian sleep-wake parameters using cutting-edge technologies published under Creative Commons, on the model of the MyConnectome experiment.
* Paper: [A Heartbeat Away From Consciousness, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30258400/): By comparing multi-scale entropy-based metrics of heart rate variability with functional magnetic resonance imagery, we demonstrated that the heart rate does reflect higher cognitive functions and especially functions that are usually associated with consciousness.

I made a lot more projects over my decades of OSSÂ development, please feel free to check the list of [my personal projects](https://github.com/lrq3000?tab=repositories) and my other contributions in other repositories.
