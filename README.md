### 👋 Welcome to Stephen Karl Larroque (LRQ3000)'s GitHub repository

🤖Artificial intelligence researcher and 🧠clinical neuroscientist, with a specialty in magnetic resonance imagery 🔎. Open-source softwares developer & maintainer, especially in 🐍Python and MATLAB. Research works cover biological & artificial consciousness, and 🛌🏽circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders🌙. Founder of the [Circadiaware Collective](https://github.com/circadiaware).

Some of my most impactful works:
* [reedsolo](https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/reedsolomon): co-author & maintainer since 2015. Sole *universal* Reed-Solomon codec, protects and repair files and communication streams. Critical component in reference solutions by key industrial actors, eg: Matter, the 2022 communication standard for connected appliances; Espressif, world leading producer of reprogrammable integrated microcircuits used in scientific prototypes and large industrial applications.
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm): core co-developer 2015-2017, top 2 committer. Easy to use yet extremely extensible, responsive and guaranteed minimal overhead progress bar. I contributed to redesign/make new core routines for these four tenets that made it widely adopted in the Python ecosystem and beyond in most data science and artificial intelligence softwares, including from big industrial actors, eg: Google, Meta, etc.
* [Coma Science Group MRI Protocol](https://github.com/lrq3000/mri_protocol): A clinical and research 3T MRI protocol running under 30 minutes, presented at CME2019, analyzable with [csg_mri_pipelines](https://github.com/lrq3000/csg_mri_pipelines). Produces cutting-edge research sequences (sub-second fmri, multi-shells dwi, flaws = structural T1 with physiological segmentation) that usually require 1-2h, all under 30min, perfect for hospitals!
* Paper: [A Heartbeat Away From Consciousness, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30258400/): By comparing multi-scale entropy-based metrics of heart rate variability with functional MRI, we demonstrated that the heart rate does reflect higher cognitive functions that are associated with consciousness.
* Book: [VLiDACMel](https://circadiaware.github.io/VLiDACMel-entrainment-therapy-non24/SleepNon24VLiDACMel.html): A management therapy for the sighted Non 24 circadian rhythm disorder, along with a 450+ pages workbook on current circadian sleep-wake rhythm science, self-published under Creative Commons. See also:
  * [Wearadian](https://github.com/Circadiaware/wearadian), a protocol and hardwares designs specifications using cutting-edge technologies for the long-term, continuous and accurate acquisition of circadian sleep-wake parameters in ambulatory, out-of-the-lab settings.
  * [MyNon24Sleep](https://figshare.com/projects/MyNon24_-_A_self-study_of_the_circadian_rhythm_and_its_altering_factors/101804), a self-study of the circadian rhythm and its altering factors, with a longitudinal 24/7 year-long dataset of circadian sleep-wake parameters using cutting-edge technologies published under Creative Commons, inspired by MyConnectome.

I made a lot more projects over my decades of OSS development, please feel free to check out:
* the list of [my projects on GitHub](https://github.com/lrq3000?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=),
* a list of [small projects](https://github.com/lrq3000/lrq3000/blob/main/other-projects.md) I am proud to have contributed to,
* my other contributions in other organizations such as [Circadiaware](https://github.com/Circadiaware),
* my [list of publications](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=Rj3IjYIAAAAJ),
* my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6248-0957).
* I also made a few [brain-related creative works](https://github.com/lrq3000/neuro-art) that got selected in art competitions.

I am also involved in open-source softwares preservation, hence why I have [lots of forks and mirrors](https://github.com/lrq3000?tab=repositories&q=&type=fork&language=&sort=) (since April 2024 I migrated to contributing sourcecodes to the [Software Heritage foundation](https://softwareheritage.org/)).

I love new collaborations, so feel free to contact me about your exciting projects!
