### üëã Welcome to Stephen Karl¬†Larroque (LRQ3000) GitHub repository

ü§ñAI researcher and üß†clinical neuroscientist, with a specialty in magnetic resonance imagery üîé. Open-source softwares developer & maintainer, especially in üêçPython and MATLAB. Research works cover biological & artificial consciousness, and üõåüèΩcircadian sleep-wake rhythm disordersüåô. Founder of the [Circadiaware Collective](https://github.com/circadiaware).

Some of my most impactful works:
* [reedsolo](https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/reedsolomon): co-author and maintainer since 2015. Sole *universal* Reed-Solomon codec, protects and restore data and communication streams. Critical component in popular solutions by key industrial actors, eg: Matter, the 2022 communication standard for connected appliances, and Espressif, world leading producer of reprogrammable electronic boards chosen for both scientific prototyping and large scale industrial applications.
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm): core co-developer 2015-2017, top 2 committer. Easy to use yet extremely extensible, responsive and guaranteed minimal overhead progress bar. I contributed to redesign or make new core routines for these four tenets that made it widely adopted in the Python ecosystem and beyond in most data science and artificial intelligence softwares, including from big industrial actors, eg: Google, Meta, etc.
* [Coma Science Group MRI Protocol](https://github.com/lrq3000/mri_protocol): A clinical and research 3T MRI protocol running under 30 minutes, presented at CME2019, analyzable with [csg_mri_pipelines](https://github.com/lrq3000/csg_mri_pipelines). Produces cutting-edge research sequences (sub-second fmri, multi-shells dwi, flaws = structural T1 with physiological segmentation) that usually require 1-2h, all under 30min, perfect for hospitals!
* Paper: [A Heartbeat Away From Consciousness, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30258400/): By comparing multi-scale entropy-based metrics of heart rate variability with functional MRI, we demonstrated that the heart rate does reflect higher cognitive functions that are associated with consciousness.
* Book: [VLiDACMel](https://circadiaware.github.io/VLiDACMel-entrainment-therapy-non24/SleepNon24VLiDACMel.html): A management therapy for the sighted Non 24 circadian rhythm disorder, along with a 450+ pages workbook on current circadian sleep-wake rhythm science, under Creative Commons. See also:
  * [Wearadian](https://github.com/Circadiaware/wearadian), a protocol and hardwares designs specifications using cutting-edge technologies for the long-term, continuous and accurate acquisition of circadian sleep-wake parameters in ambulatory, out-of-the-lab settings.
  * [MyNon24Sleep](https://figshare.com/projects/MyNon24_-_A_self-study_of_the_circadian_rhythm_and_its_altering_factors/101804), a self-study of the circadian rhythm and its altering factors, with a longitudinal 24/7 year-long dataset of circadian sleep-wake parameters using cutting-edge technologies published under Creative Commons, inspired by MyConnectome.

I made a lot more projects over my decades of OSS¬†development, please feel free to check the list of [my personal projects](https://github.com/lrq3000?tab=repositories) and my other contributions in other repositories, my [list of publications](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=Rj3IjYIAAAAJ), my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6248-0957).

I am very open to new collaborations, so feel free to contact me about your exciting projects!
