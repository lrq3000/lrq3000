### Welcome to Stephen Karl Larroque (LRQ3000) GitHub softwares repository 👋

🤖AI researcher and 🧠clinical neuroscientist, with a specialty in magnetic resonance imagery 🔎. Open-source softwares developer & maintainer, especially in 🐍Python and MATLAB. I am particularly interested in researching biological consciousness, artificial consciousness, and 🛌🏽circadian sleep-wake rhythm disorders🌙. Founder of the [Circadiaware Collective](https://github.com/circadiaware).

Some of my most popular works:
* [reedsolo](https://github.com/tomerfiliba-org/reedsolomon): co-author and current maintainer since 2015. Only universal Reed-Solomon codec, protects and restore data and communication streams. Used by key industrial actors, eg: Matter, the 2022 communication standard for connected appliances, and Espressif, a world leading producer of reprogrammable electronic boards chosen for most scientific prototyping devices to large scale industrial applications.
* [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm): core co-developer between 2015 and 2017, 2nd largest contributor. An easy to use yet surprisingly extensible and infinitely fast progress bar. I contributed to redesign core routines for more extensibility formally guarantee speed, which led to its wide adoption not only in the Python ecosystem but also beyond in most data science and especially artificial intelligence software, including from big industrial actors such as Google, Meta, etc.
* [Coma Science Group MRI Protocol](https://github.com/lrq3000/mri_protocol): A clinical and research 3T MRI protocol running under 30 minutes, presented at CME2019, analyzable with [csg_mri_pipelines](https://github.com/lrq3000/csg_mri_pipelines). Produces cutting-edge research sequences (sub-second fmri, multi-shells dwi, flaws = structural T1 with physiological segmentation) that usually require 1-2h, all under 30min, perfect for hospitals!
* Paper: [A Heartbeat Away From Consciousness, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30258400/): By comparing multi-scale entropy-based metrics of heart rate variability with functional MRI, we demonstrated that the heart rate does reflect higher cognitive functions and especially functions that are usually associated with consciousness.
* Book: [VLiDACMel](https://circadiaware.github.io/VLiDACMel-entrainment-therapy-non24/SleepNon24VLiDACMel.html): A management therapy for the sighted Non 24 circadian rhythm disorder, along with a 450+ pages workbook on current circadian sleep-wake rhythm science, under Creative Commons. See also:
  * [Wearadian](https://github.com/Circadiaware/wearadian), a protocol and material design specifications using cutting-edge technologies for the long-term, continuous and accurate acquisition of circadian sleep-wake parameters in out-of-the-lab settings.
  * [MyNon24Sleep](https://figshare.com/projects/MyNon24_-_A_self-study_of_the_circadian_rhythm_and_its_altering_factors/101804), a self-study of the circadian rhythm and its altering factors, with a longitudinal 24/7 year-long dataset of circadian sleep-wake parameters using cutting-edge technologies published under Creative Commons, on the model of the MyConnectome experiment.

I made a lot more projects over my decades of OSS development, please feel free to check the list of [my personal projects](https://github.com/lrq3000?tab=repositories) and my other contributions in other repositories.
